                          CARDEKHO.COM is a start up created by two IIT graduates as a hobby during
                          their undergraduation period. The site was created for the basic comparision of two
                          cars. Their specifications can be compared. The visitors can choose the models
                          of their choice. The comparision includes the price value, the milege , the specifications
                          and many more things. CARDEKHO.COM is not just about the comparision, but also you can sell
                          and buy the cars.
